    1. What is a Cookie: 
        - Cookie is a small text file on your browser (client-side)
        - Originally, Cookie contains information about user and the user 
            preferences
            For i.e: cookie can contains your preference language, 
                time you visited a website, your location
            Later on, as information grow, cookie file must grow beyond its
            shape
        - Cookie now only contains an id as an identifier so that
            website can access and store all your preferences in their system
        - Websites can access and write to your Cookie if allowed
