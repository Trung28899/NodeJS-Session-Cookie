II. Core Concepts: 
    1. What is a Cookie: 
        - Cookie is a small text file on your browser (client-side)
        - Originally, Cookie contains information about user and the user 
            preferences
            For i.e: cookie can contains your preference language, 
                time you visited a website, your location
            Later on, as information grow, cookie file must grow beyond its
            shape
        - Cookie now only contains an id as an identifier so that
            website can access and store all your preferences in their system
        - Websites can access and write to your Cookie if allowed 
        - Cookie is not related to website, it is a global file that 
            can be access by any web application

    2. What is Session: 
        - Session: 
            +, is a data structure that contain user data, 
            +, is stored in the server-side
            +, share information across requests of the same user
            +, doesn't share information across user
        - With Session, Cookie must contain user id as an identifier
        - See Session and Cookie relationship in this image: 
        https://drive.google.com/file/d/1buX-IXZh5G_TGs5HTqWCrAFxDltWIFqq/view?usp=sharing        

III. Module Notes: 
    1. Setting and Getting basic Cookies: 
        - Code in 3rd Commit
        - See note what is a cookie above
        - See controllers/auth.js for how to set and get basic 
            Cookie
    
    2. Setting Cookie Configs: 
        - Forgot to commit this code, see video 236 (not really important)
        - See controllers/auth.js for how to set Cookie Configs
        - Note that often time we won't set cookie manually like this, 
            this is just a demonstration for understanding 
            the basic
    
    3. Setting and Using Basic Session: 
        - Code in 4th Commit
        - See note for what is session above
        - How to set up session see in app.js
        - How to set and use cookie variable in ./controllers/auth.js

    4. Using MongoDB to store session: 
        - Code in 5th Commit
        - See app.js for how to set up configurations 
            +, see store constant and middleware to set up session
        - Now we hit login in the /login route, we'll have a record in 
            mongodb under shop, under session collection
